2.4.3 and below st00fz

camera pointer is a double pointer! first offset is 732c second offset points to what you want with the camera (because i'm lazy i am not going to expand on this, i will leave finding specific offsets to you) one offset i do know (thanks to kyonx) is 100 which is camera Z, if your interested in expanding on it, you might find this to be helpful.

2.4.3 VMT pointers

although these address aren't constant through patches they will always be at the start of the specific structure in memory (ie, if you searched for the player constant in CE or some other debugger, all the addresses that appear will be players around you *or you*)

0x008C32B8 PLAYER VMT pointer
0x008C5580 UNIT VMT pointer
0x008C3A70 CONTAINER VMT pointer
0x008C3B60 ITEM VMT pointer
0x008CFF90 M2 VMT pointer
0x008C4AF0 GAME_OBJECT VMT pointer
0x008C3860 DYNAMIC_OBJECT VMT pointer
0x008C39B8 CORPSE VMT pointer

to use these simply open up CE, click the add address manually button, select pointer and use the base address (which i posted at the top) as the address and these number/letter combo's (such as C6C for walk speed) to get the actual value.

here are also some notes i took on it.







*notes*

movement state

movement state can be used to unroot you, if you ever find yourself rooted. just set it to 00000000 (8 0's) and you will be unrooted, this counts for logging out root/gm root/griffen riding root (unrooting yourself while on a griffen has some weird effects,)

0x1 = Moving Forward
0x2 = Moving Backward
0x4 = Strafing Left
0x8 = Strafing Right
0x10 = Turning Left
0x20 = Turning Right
0x100 = Walking
0x400 = floaty thing
0x1000 = falling
0x4000 = Fall Forwards
0x8000 = Fall Backwards
0x2000 = Freefall/Jumping
0x10000 = Strafing while jumping
0x200000 = Swimming
0x10000000 = Spirit Form
0x80000000 = Unknown

*note: 0x400 in particular interests me, it lets you levitate at the same height, you can go up but never down, it basically lets you walk on air at the same height you are at, (example, im on a cliff. i walk off cliff, instead of falling, i still walk at the same height as before)*

movement type

1 = flyhack (can land)
2 = flyhack (can't land *swim-like*)
16 = whisp * walk on water*
64 = floating (levitate)
80 = (floaty dead?)
128 = normal
129 = (flyhack actual gm-like value)
130 = (flyhack *theres alot of different ones heres another, swim-like*)
144 = (dead) *walk on water*
160 = slow fall

notes: playerState *note* this is the real player state.
0x000008 not in combat *can be used to fake not in combat
0x00000C logging out *can be used to wall-climb
0x001008 pvp toggled * can be used to either force others to be pvp toggled >:3
0x080008 in combat
0x10000C on a taxi
0x400008 blinded

also, the lower the value of the mountain climb angle the steeper the angle you can climb.
